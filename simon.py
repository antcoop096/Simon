HOW TO PLAY:

The game will start after the countdown.

At first, a single color will be flashed to
the screen, either red, blue, green, or yellow.

After the color is flashed you must press
the correct button on your keyboard that
represents the flashed color:
游댮 = R
游댯 = B
游릭 = G
游리 = Y

If you guess the color correcly, the color
will be breifly flashed to the screen, a thumbs-up emoji
will be shown, and the next round will begin.

Each round will add a new color to the sequence.

You must press the buttons in the correct order 
of the sequence to advance to the next round.

For Example:
Round 1 sequence: 游댮 
Correct guess: r
Round 2 sequence: 游댮游댯
Correct guess: rb
Round 3 sequence: 游댮游댯游댯
Correct guess: rbb
...

Guessing a color in the sequence incorrectly will
end the game, and your score will be the number of rounds 
you have previously and successfully completed.

PLEASE NOTE: before entering the guess for the next color in
the sequence, wait until the color of the previous guess is
no longer breifly flashed to the screen.
